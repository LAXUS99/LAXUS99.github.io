    <h2>Story</h2>

	<img src="image\Fallout4 Family Story.jpg" alt="Fallout4 Family Story" />

	<p class="Story-P">The story of Fallout 4 focuses on a spouse, the Sole Survivor of Vault 111, as they search for their missing child, Shaun. Fallout 4 is set in and around the Boston area in 2287, 10 years after Fallout 3. Along the way, the Sole Survivor discovers a world in fear of a mysterious organization known as the Institute, consumed by paranoia of a race of robotic yet also biological human-like beings known as synths. As a result of the synth-focused narrative, the Sole Survivor, as well as the player, are faced with ethical questions such as how far people should experiment with science, the morality of creating sentient living machines that express emotions and suffering, and what it means to be human. Story elements from previous games are present, primarily Fallout 3.</p>

	<h2>Map</h2>

	<img src="image\worldmap fallout4  institute.jpg" alt="World Map" />
	
	 <p>The game takes place in The Commonwealth which is composed mainly of the former state of Massachusetts and is set heavily in the eastern portion of the state. The largest and central city of the game is Boston but also includes the surrounding towns and cities of Cambridge, Concord, Lexington, Malden, Nahant, Natick, Quincy, Revere, and Salem. Other real-world locations are represented in less detail, such as Bedford which has been replaced simply with Bedford Station. The game also includes some fictional towns, such as Sanctuary Hills where the game begins.

		The Sole Survivor in Diamond City
		
		Famous local landmarks like the Paul Revere Monument, the USS Constitution, as well as the Massachusetts State House with its unique golden dome, are included in the game world. Other locations that make an appearance in the game are Scollay Square, renamed Goodneighbor, Bunker Hill, and the baseball stadium Fenway Park which has become a shantytown called Diamond City.
		
		In Fallout 4, the Boston area has been quite flooded compared to real-life, with new rivers. A large and still inhospitable nuclear blast site called the Glowing Sea is to the southwest. The starting area in the northwest contains low level enemies and is relatively safe, but the enemies get progressively tougher towards the southeast area of the map.</p>

	   <h2>settlements</h2>

	   <img src="image\settlements.jpg">
         
	   <p> In Fallout 4, the Survivor can build and manage their own settlements at various sites around the Commonwealth. The workshop interface is used to place and connect pre-fabricated structures as well as individual pieces (walls, floors, roofs, etc.) letting the player character construct their own home base(s) as they desire.</p>

	   <p>
		Once built, these settlements can be customized extensively. Inside buildings and structures, furniture, decorations, and lights can be placed for aesthetic purposes; outside these structures, the player character can plant crops, create water and power supplies, and tend to the defensive needs of their new settlement. To accumulate resources for their settlements, the player character can scrap most interactive inventory items.
		
		Once a settlement reaches a certain size and/or the player character obtains necessary perks, they can invite others to set up shop at their base by building unique resources such as the trading post, which adds a vendor NPC stocking in-game items. With the required perk, it is also possible to establish supply lines between settlements to share resources and inventory among them.</p>

   <div id="fight"></div>
   <section>
	   <h2>Fight</h2>

	   <img src="image\F4 Combat.jpg" alt="Combat System" >

	   <p>A returning gameplay feature is the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (V.A.T.S.), which can play a critical part in combat. While using V.A.T.S, real-time combat is slowed down, and action is played out from varying camera angles in a computer graphics version of "bullet time." Attacking in V.A.T.S. costs action points, limiting the number of actions available at a time, and the player can target specific body areas for attacks to inflict specific injuries; headshots can be used for quick kills or blinding, legs can be targeted to slow enemies' movements, and opponents can be disarmed by shooting at their weapons.</p>

	   <p>A change is how Fallout 4 handles critical hits. Before, they were were random while striking enemies. Fallout 4 gets rid of the Critical Chance statistic and now there is a critical meter that will fill up and players can decide when to execute a critical hit.</p>

	  <h2>weapons</h2>

	  <img src="image\Fallout-4 Rifel Edit.jpg" alt="Wepons image" >

	  <p> Fallout 4 contains hundreds of various weapons, and each weapon has dozens of add-ons. The weapons fall into several categories: Pistols/Rifles/Shotguns/Pipe weapons/Heavy weapons/Energy weapons/Plasma/Radiation weapons/Poison weapons/Explosives/Traps/Melee weapons /and other ... , Weapons in Fallout 4 fall into three categories, including Regular, Legendary, and Unique. Regular weapons have no special bonuses on them at all. Legendary weapons come with random bonuses applied to them and are only dropped by legendary enemies. Unique weapons are already named weapons and will always keep the same special bonuses. Unique pieces are usually purchased from merchants or are important bonuses. Regular and Legendary weapons will change their name when modifications are applied, and unique weapons will not.</p>

	  <p>In Other Casees If a player character puts any weapons, including unique and legendary weapons in a container in a settlement, nearby NPCs, like settlers or even enemy attackers, can randomly take them and they may be irretrievable. This cannot be totally prevented by any form of barrier or obstacle. Store valuable weapons in an unpopulated settlement, in an interior cell, or on an Armor rack.</p>

	  <h2>Items</h2>

	  <img src="image\F4 Junk.jpg" alt="Items image" >

	  <p>Fallout 4 contains thousands of different items, and items fall into several categories
		Ammunition/Armor and clothing/Consumables/Crafting (schemics)/Holotapes/Notes/Keys/Magazines/Weapons/
		Junk items refer to the miscellaneous clutter found scattered all over the Commonwealth, such as toys, housewares, garbage, and tools that the Sole Survivor can collect. Junk items are found in their own inventory section in the Pip-Boy. They cannot be equipped, consumed or interacted with by themselves like weapons or food, although they can be dropped or sold to vendors. Their primary use is in crafting, either as ingredients for more useful items (weapons, armor, chems, mods, settlement buildings, etc.) or for breaking down into their raw components. After accessing the inventory on a workbench or crafting station at an allied settlement, all junk items can automatically be transferred into the workbench and are available for crafting at the settlement, as well as all settlements connected to it via a supply line. Junk items can also be automatically transferred into non-player character owned crafting stations, but they will not be shared between the crafting stations in the area.</p>

		<p>Crafting components
			All junk items consist of one or more "components,” a general term for the materials that make up each junk item. When crafting anything out of junk, the most readily available junk is broken down to its base components, and whatever ingredients needed for the recipe are consumed to make the crafted item. Any components not used are stored in either the player character’s inventory or the settlement workbench, depending on where the player character is crafting and where they are storing their junk. There are 31 base components total, that cannot be broken down further into anything else</p>

	  <h2>RPG</h2>

	  <img src="image\Fallout_4_perk_poster.jpg" alt="Special Perks" >

	  <p>The new perk system of Fallout 4 has merged with the skill system of previous games. Each time the player character gains a level they gain a perk point. This point can be expended on an increase in the rank of a primary SPECIAL attribute, or on one of the SPECIAL perks. Every rank of the SPECIAL attributes and perks costs 1 perk point. This is all manageable from the perk chart screen within the Pip-Boy.

		In addition, there are other perks that can be gained through the player character's actions, such as reading a magazine, which don't use up perk points. Unless otherwise specified, all perks are permanent. When obtained, these perks are viewable on the Pip-Boy's perks screen, which is separate from the perk chart.</p>

		<p><b> SPECIAL perks </b></p>
		
		<p>SPECIAL perks are obtainable via spending perk points in the perk chart. Each perk has a base SPECIAL requirement that must be met before it can be taken; this is based off the starting stats chosen upon character creation, along with any increases to those stats obtained through spending perk points. Obtaining the SPECIAL-bobbleheads and "You're SPECIAL!" also increase the base SPECIAL stats, potentially allowing new perks to be selected. However, SPECIAL stats granted through temporary means such as equipment, chems, and alcohol do not affect which perks may be taken.
			
			The perk chart does not follow a strict "tree" format; any perk may be selected in any order so long as its base SPECIAL requirement is met. Perks higher up on the chart (with lower base SPECIAL requirements) do not have to be obtained prior to obtaining perks lower on the chart (with higher base SPECIAL requirements).
			
			Each perk has multiple ranks. Each rank costs one perk point and grants new bonuses; however each rank must be purchased in order. Initial perk ranks have no level requirement and may be taken as soon as their base SPECIAL requirement is met, but additional ranks also impose a level requirement, preventing perks from reaching their full potential right away. The level required varies by perk and rank. Level 50 is required to meet higher rank requirements for all of the perks.</p>
